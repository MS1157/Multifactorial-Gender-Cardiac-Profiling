# Multifactorial-Gender-Cardiac-Profiling
"This repository explores the cardiac profiles of different genders. Using data analysis and machine learning, this project attempts to find patterns and create profiles of cardiac characteristics. The goal is to provide insight into gender based cardiac differences."

This repository contains code and data for a project focused on developing comprehensive cardiac profiles based on multifactorial data on basics of Gender . We aim to analyze and model the complex relationships between various demographic and physiological factors, including:
* **Gender**
* **Age**
* **Weight**
* **Height**
* **BMI (Body Mass Index)**
* **Body Temperature**
* **Calories Burned**
* **Heart Rate**

## Dependencies
* Python 
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

## Project Objectives

* Develop a robust model to predict heart rate based on the aforementioned multifactorial data and Gender.
* Analyze and visualize the influence of each parameter on cardiac activity.
* Identify significant correlations and patterns in cardiac data.
* Create detailed cardiac profiles that highlight gender-specific differences.
* Contribute to a deeper understanding of cardiovascular health and potentially inform future gender-specific healthcare strategies.
